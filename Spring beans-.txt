Spring beans:-
============
The objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container. These beans are created with the configuration metadata that you supply to the container. For example, in the form of XML <bean/> definitions which you have already seen in the previous chapters.

Bean definition contains the information called configuration metadata, which is needed for the container to know the following âˆ’

How to create a bean
Bean's lifecycle details
Bean's dependencies
All the above configuration metadata translates into a set of the following properties that make up each bean definition.

Properties:-
	
-> class-This attribute is mandatory and specifies the bean class to be used to create the bean.
	
-> name-This attribute specifies the bean identifier uniquely. In XMLbased configuration metadata, you use the id and/or name attributes 
   to specify the bean identifier(s).
	
-> scope-This attribute specifies the scope of the objects created from a particular bean definition and it will be discussed in bean 
   scopes chapter.
	
-> constructor-arg-This is used to inject the dependencies and will be discussed in subsequent chapters.

-> properties-This is used to inject the dependencies and will be discussed in subsequent chapters.
	
-> autowiring mode-This is used to inject the dependencies and will be discussed in subsequent chapters.
	
-> lazy-initialization mode-A lazy-initialized bean tells the IoC container to create a bean instance when it is first requested, rather 
   than at the startup.
	
-> initialization method-A callback to be called just after all necessary properties on the bean have been set by the container. It will 
   be discussed in bean life cycle chapter.
	
-> destruction method-A callback to be used when the container containing the bean is destroyed. It will be discussed in bean life cycle 
   chapter.
