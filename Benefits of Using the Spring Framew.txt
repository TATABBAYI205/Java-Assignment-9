Benefits of Using the Spring Framework:-
======================================
  Following is the list of few of the great benefits of using Spring Framework −

-> Spring enables developers to develop enterprise-class applications using POJOs. The benefit of using only POJOs is that you do not need 
   an EJB container product such as an application server but you have the option of using only a robust servlet container such as Tomcat 
   or some commercial product.

-> Spring is organized in a modular fashion. Even though the number of packages and classes are substantial, you have to worry only about 
   the ones you need and ignore the rest.

-> Spring does not reinvent the wheel, instead it truly makes use of some of the existing technologies like several ORM frameworks, 
   logging frameworks, JEE, Quartz and JDK timers, and other view technologies.

-> Testing an application written with Spring is simple because environment-dependent code is moved into this framework. Furthermore, by 
   using JavaBeanstyle POJOs, it becomes easier to use dependency injection for injecting test data.

-> Spring's web framework is a well-designed web MVC framework, which provides a great alternative to web frameworks such as Struts or 
   other over-engineered or less popular web frameworks.

-> Spring provides a convenient API to translate technology-specific exceptions (thrown by JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO, for example) into 
   consistent, unchecked exceptions.

-> Lightweight IoC containers tend to be lightweight, especially when compared to EJB containers, for example. This is beneficial for 
   developing and deploying applications on computers with limited memory and CPU resources.

-> Spring provides a consistent transaction management interface that can scale down to a local transaction (using a single database, for 
   example) and scale up to global transactions (using JTA, for example).
