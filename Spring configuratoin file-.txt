Spring configuratoin file:-
=========================

-> In the Spring Framework, a Spring configuration file is an XML or Java-based file that contains the configuration information required by 
   the framework to create and manage beans (objects) within an application. The configuration file is responsible for defining the 
   structure and behavior of the Spring application context.

-> In XML-based configuration, the most commonly used configuration file is typically named applicationContext.xml or a custom name ending 
   with .xml. This file contains the bean definitions, which specify how the objects are created, wired, and managed by the Spring 
   container.

-> So far you have seen how we configure Spring beans using XML configuration file. If you are comfortable with XML configuration, then it 
   is really not required to learn how to proceed with Java-based configuration as you are going to achieve the same result using either of 
   the configurations available.

-> Java-based configuration option enables you to write most of your Spring configuration without XML but with the help of few Java-based 
   annotations explained in this chapter.

@Configuration & @Bean Annotations
-> Annotating a class with the @Configuration indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean 
  definitions. The @Bean annotation tells Spring that a method annotated with @Bean will return an object that should be registered as a 
  bean in the Spring application context.
